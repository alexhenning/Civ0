TODO for civ0

* For 0.1 Functioning alpha
** AI
*** TODO [#B] Add lazy city defenders.
*** TODO [#B] Add lazy city attackers
** UI
*** TODO [#A] When selecting a tech, the status bar should show a short description of it.
It works in firefox, but not chromium?
*** TODO [#C] When hovering over land while a settler is the active unit, the status bar should show relevent details.
ie. "A city can't be built here" or "A city built here has the potential for 14 points (12f/0p/2t)"
*** Fix build queques
**** TODO [#C] Coloring of the queques
**** DONE [#A] Being able to actually see the queque
**** TODO [#B] Limit buildings/units that should only be built in port cities
** TODO [#A] Fix fog of war
Sometimes it takes a turn or two before tiles are revealed.
** TODO [#A] On death of final unit, game gets screwy... Fix!
It crashes with the error:
: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'active' of undefined index.htm:1914 
"Resume" gives you control of an enemy unit, but you can't see it.
The desired behavior is that the game asks you if you want to change any of your cities production and then runs the AI till you produce a unit or it overruns you.

Also was triggered by the following error even though not all units were dead.
: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'player' of undefined (index.htm:980)
: CombatNeighboringUnit (index.htm:980)
: MoveUnitToDestination (index.htm:1028)
: EndOfTurn (index.htm:1896)
: Turn (index.htm:1886)
: i (index.htm:1974)
: KeyPressHandler (index.htm:1765)
: (anonymous function) (index.htm:20)
: onkeypress (index.htm:20)
** TODO [#B] Allow cities to be captured
** TODO [#C] Barracks doesn't actually work...
Barracks should increase veterancy of built units; in reality it doesn't/

* Eventually... (like really low priority...)
** TODO Support android phones
** TODO Support blackberry devices
** TODO Support iphones
** TODO Support ipad
** TODO Fancy terrain rendering
Render each tile so that it's less blocky by taking into account surrounding territory.
** TODO Add multiple AI "nationalities"
Just add a few AI cities with different colors and units with matching colors.
