sTODO for Civ0

* For 0.1 Functioning alpha
At this point we should focus on anything that either makes the game unplayable so that the game is playable. *All else is secondary*
** TODO [#A] On death of final unit, game gets screwy... Fix!
It crashes with the error:
: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'active' of undefined index.htm:1914 
"Resume" gives you control of an enemy unit, but you can't see it.
The desired behavior is that the game asks you if you want to change any of your cities production and then runs the AI till you produce a unit or it overruns you.

Also was triggered by the following error even though not all units were dead. (Possibly related to the removing of AI defense of a city; will look into. [Confirmed])
Suspect RemoveDefenders()
Fixed it, and it appears that this is no longer an issue.
: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'player' of undefined (index.htm:980)

Also triggered by killing all of my units, by having them fight each other.

** TODO [#A] Fix fog of war
Sometimes it takes a turn or two before tiles are revealed.
** UI
*** TODO [#A] When selecting a tech, the status bar should show a short description of it.
It works in firefox, but not chromium?

Try a new event on the hovering over of tech options. I'll look one up when I land.
*** TODO [#C] When hovering over land while a settler is the active unit, the status bar should show relevent details.
ie. "A city can't be built here" or "A city built here has the potential for 14 points (12f/0p/2t)"
*** Fix build queques
**** TODO [#C] Coloring of the queques
**** DONE Being able to actually see the queque
**** TODO [#B] Limit buildings/units that should only be built in port cities
** AI
*** TODO [#B] Add lazy city defenders.
Maybe done?
*** TODO [#B] Add lazy city attackers
Not done?
** TODO [#B] Allow cities to be captured
Done?
** DONE Barracks doesn't actually work...
Barracks should increase veterancy of built units; in reality it doesn't.

Didn't realize it's effect was random, and had really bad luck apparently.

* Eventually... (like really low priority...)
** TODO Support android phones
** TODO Support blackberry devices
** TODO Support iphones
** TODO Support ipad
** TODO Fancy terrain rendering
Render each tile so that it's less blocky by taking into account surrounding territory.
** TODO Add multiple AI "nationalities"
Just add a few AI cities with different colors and units with matching colors.
